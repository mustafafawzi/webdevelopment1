                        football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players,
                        using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms,
                        try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal.
                        Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding
                        the goal.
                        The team that scores more goals wins. Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of
                        participants and spectators.

                        A gym, short for gymnasium (pl: gymnasiums or gymnasia), is an indoor venue for exercise and sports. The
                        word is derived from the ancient Greek term "gymnasion".[1] They are commonly found in athletic and fitness
                        centers, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang for "fitness
                        centre", which is often an area for indoor recreation. A "gym" may include or describe adjacent open air
                        areas as well. In Western countries, "gyms" often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts for
                        basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with equipment and machines used for physical
                        development training, or to do exercises. In many European countries, Gymnasium (and variations of the word)
                        also can describe a secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a university, with or
                        without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.
