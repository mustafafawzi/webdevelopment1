        <p>
            A gym, short for gymnasium (pl: gymnasiums or gymnasia), is an indoor venue for exercise and sports. The
            word is derived from the ancient Greek term "gymnasion".[1] They are commonly found in athletic and fitness
            centers, and as activity and learning spaces in educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang for "fitness
            centre", which is often an area for indoor recreation. A "gym" may include or describe adjacent open air
            areas as well. In Western countries, "gyms" often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts for
            basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or wrestling, and with equipment and machines used for physical
            development training, or to do exercises. In many European countries, Gymnasium (and variations of the word)
            also can describe a secondary school that prepares students for higher education at a university, with or
            without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or equipment.
